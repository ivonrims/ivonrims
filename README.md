### My skills:
- Python (pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn), Git
- SQL (JOIN, subqueries, window functions), have experience working with ClickHouse, MySQL, PostgreSQL
- Based on A/B testing, I can draw conclusions about the product
- Data visualization and working with BI systems (Superset, Tableau, Redash)
- Building an ETL pipeline in Airflow, automating anomaly detection and reporting with sending reports via Telegram Bot.
- The simplest methods for predicting metrics, ML algorithms

### My projects:
| Name | Results | Tools |
|:----------:|:-----------------:|:-------------:|
| Metric analysis with CausalImpact. Evaluate the effectiveness of the flashmob. | During the flashmob, a statistically significant increase in four out of six metrics selected for analysis was observed. | Python, Jupyter Notebook, CausalImpact |
| A/B testing | А/А-test, А/B-tests using different approaches | Python, Jupyter Notebook, ClickHouse, stats |
| Metrics forecasting, ML algorithms. It is necessary to predict how user activity will change over the next month. | The metric selected is the number of actions per hour (HAU). Two learning models were tested on a test group: DLT with a regressor and the MAP estimation algorithm + KTR model with a regressor. Based on a comparison of the RMSE of two models, the KTR model was chosen to make the forecast. | Python, Orbit, pandas, seaborn, Jupyter Notebook, ClickHouse |
| Anomaly  detection, alert system | The system should check key metrics every 15 minutes. If an anomalous value is detected, an alert should be sent to the chat. | Python, SQL, ClickHouse, ETL-pipeline in Airflow, Telegram-bot |
| Automation of app reporting | The report contains: the value of key metrics for the previous day, comparison of metric values ​​for yesterday with values ​​1 and 7 days ago, figures. | Python, SQL, ClickHouse, ETL-pipeline in Airflow, Telegram-bot |
